>Bio:
	I’m a girl who codes from San Jose, CA. I’ll be a junior in the fall, and I’m looking forward to the experiences I’ll have this year. I live at home with my parents, and my four birds. Their names are Gigi, Coco, Kipper, and Calcifer. I like to listen to music, sleep, look at memes, and hang out with my friends.

Likes: I love waterpolo, going to concerts, and any crime TV show that is on Hulu or Netflix.

Dislikes: I don’t like small talk or energy drinks.

Fun Fact: I’m really good with most animals.

Favorite Websites/Apps:
Spotify: I like to listen to music non stop
Youtube: I use it to watch videos and Vines
Hulu: It has Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and has a larger library than Netflix! -->
